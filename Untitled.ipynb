    "# One-day Synthetic Solar Irradiance Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This software uses an `stochastic` and `bootstrap` method to generate one-day synthetic solar irradiance data at a minimum 60-minute time resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software required to define eight parameters to execute:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `DF`: Input dataset that contains the measured solar irradiance. Must be a `pd.Dataframe`.\n",
    "2. `COL`: Column of the pd.DataFrame of the solar irradiance (input data).\n",
    "3. `YEAR`: Year of study. Must exist in the input dataset.\n",
    "4. `MONTH`: Month of study (1 to 12). Must exist in the input dataset.\n",
    "5. `SC`: Sky condition of study. Must be 'sc1', 'sc2', 'sc3', 'sc4' or 'sc5'. Corresponds to fully covered, mostly covered, partially covered, mostly clear and totally clear, respectively.\n",
    "6. `METHOD`: Method to generate the synthetic data. Must be 'stochastic' or 'bootstrap'.\n",
    "7. `IC`: Confidence interval. Must be a value between 0 and 1. The suggested value is 0.95.\n",
    "8. `RUNS`: Quantity of one-day synthetic sequences to generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the software is a one-day synthetic solar irradiance time series with the same time resolution of the input dataset. It will be generated as many sequences as defined in the `RUNS` parameter.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Instalation\n",
    "\n",
    "A specific python environment called `synthetic` will be created to run the methods and the necessary packages will be installed. For this, open the terminal and from the `(base)` environment move to the directory where you have downloaded the folder of this repository. For instance, if you have downloaded the folder to your desktop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```terminal\n",
    "cd C:\\user\\Desktop\\synthetic_irradiance\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, create the environment with the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```terminal\n",
    "conda env create --file environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, activate the environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```terminal\n",
    "conda activate synthetic\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing the previous command, you must be in the corresponding environment, in this case denoted by `(synthetic)`. Now the respective kernel of the newly created environment is installed with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```terminal\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name synthetic --display-name \"synthetic\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, run the following command to start the Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "```terminal\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uninstall\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to delete the `synthetic` environment, run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```terminal\n",
    "conda env remove -n synthetic\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to remove the created `synthetic` kernel, run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```terminal\n",
    "jupyter kernelspec remove synthetic\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "In the root folder of the repository, the `notebook.ipynb` file contains the description for the basic usage of the code. This same file is suggested to be used as a template to generate the synthetic data. It is just needed to adaptate the input parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the code pipeline is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import src\n",
    "import pvlib\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "First, upload the input dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv(filepath_or_buffer=f'./validations/data/bogota-5.csv', sep=',', decimal='.', index_col='timestamp', parse_dates=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, define the input parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "DF = df\n",
    "COL = 'poa_wm2'\n",
    "YEAR = 2023\n",
    "MONTH = 1\n",
    "SC = 'sc5'\n",
    "METHOD = 'stochastic'\n",
    "IC = 0.95\n",
    "RUNS = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, generate the one-day synthetic solar irradiance time series with the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "synthetic = src.methods.sequential(data=DF,\n",
    "                                   irradiance_column=COL,\n",
    "                                   year=YEAR,\n",
    "                                   month=MONTH,\n",
    "                                   sky_condition=SC,\n",
    "                                   method=METHOD,\n",
    "                                   IC=IC,\n",
    "                                   resolution=RESOLUTION,\n",
    "                                   runs=RUNS)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function will return a `pd.DataFrame` for each sky condition (i.e., fully covered, mostly covered, partially covered, mostly clear and totally clear) with a number of columns given by the `RUNS` parameters and the timestamps as an index.\n",
