  abstract = {There is an urgent need to develop and optimize tools for designing large wind farm arrays for deployment offshore. This research is focused on improving the understanding of, and modeling of, wind turbine wakes in order to make more accurate power output predictions for large offshore wind farms. Detailed data ensembles of power losses due to wakes at the large wind farms at Nysted and Horns Rev are presented and analyzed. Differences in turbine spacing (10.5 versus 7 rotor diameters) are not differentiable in wake-related power losses from the two wind farms. This is partly due to the high variability in the data despite careful data screening. A number of ensemble averages are simulated with a range of wind farm and computational fluid dynamics models and compared to observed wake losses. All models were able to capture wake width to some degree, and some models also captured the decrease of power output moving through the wind farm. Rootmean-square errors indicate a generally better model performance for higher wind speeds (10 rather than 6 m s21) and for direct down the row flow than for oblique angles. Despite this progress, wake modeling of large wind farms is still subject to an unacceptably high degree of uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Simulating turbine wakes offshore presents significant challenges. Experiments suggest that the standard wake models, e.g. Park (Jensen) and Eddy Viscosity (Ainslie), tend to underestimate wake losses, especially after the third or fourth row. New models are beginning to be used which are intended to improve predictions. Some are based on the surfacedrag-induced internal boundary layer approach of Frandsen (2007). Other promising alternatives include computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods such as Reynolds-averaged NavierStokes (RANS) models and large eddy simulations (LES). The former are usually run in a steady state mode without buoyancy. In contrast, LES takes into account the influence of unsteadiness and thermal stratification, but with a severe cost in computing power. The performance of these various approaches to wake modeling is compared using observations for two offshore wind projects.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of wind measurements from a series of airborne campaigns conducted to sample the wakes from two North Sea wind farm clusters, with the aim of determining the dependence of the downstream wind speed recovery on the atmospheric stability. The consequences of the stability dependence of wake length on the expected annual energy yield of wind farms in the North Sea are assessed by an engineering model. Wakes are found to extend for significantly longer downstream distances ({$>$}50 km) in stable conditions than in neutral and unstable conditions ( 15 km). The parameters of one common engineering model are modified to reproduce the observed wake decay at downstream distances 30 km. More significant effects on the energy yield are expected for wind farms separated by distances 30 km, which is generally the case in the North Sea, but additional data would be required to validate the suggested parameter modifications within the engineering model. A case study is accordingly performed to show reductions in the farm efficiency downstream of a wind farm. These results emphasize not only the importance of understanding the impact of atmospheric stability on offshore wind farms but also the need to update the representation of wakes in current industry models to properly include wake-induced energy losses, especially in large offshore clusters.},

  abstract = {In recent years, adopting renewable energy, such as wind power, has become a national energy policy for many countries due to concerns of pollution and climate change from fossil fuel consumption. However, accurate prediction of wind is crucial in managing the power load. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are essential tools for wind prediction, but they need accurate initial conditions in order to produce an accurate forecast. However, NWP models are not guaranteed to have accurate initial conditions over wind farms in isolated locations. This study hypothesizes that short-term, 0e3 h, wind forecast can be improved by assimilating anemometer wind speed observations from wind farm turbines into a numerical weather forecast system. A technique was developed to circumvent the requirement of simultaneously ingesting the wind speed and direction in a data assimilation/weather forecasting system. A six-day case study revealed that assimilating wind speed can improve the 0e3 h wind speed (power) forecast by reducing the mean absolute error up to 0.5e0.6 m sÀ1 (30e40\%).},

It is done using six-hourly interval 1◦ × 1◦ NCEP FNL analysis data for initial simulation. The system advisor model version SAM 2017.9.5 is used to estimate wind energy performance with the power purchase agreement (single owner) model. The results show the lowest average wind speed is 3.83 m/s obtained in November with an average monthly energy of 3.8 GWh for 100 m height and 5.57 GWh for 120 m height. The highest average monthly wind energy is 33.9 GWh obtained in January for 100 m height and 50 GWh for 120 m height when average wind speeds from both heights reached ±9 m/s. Finally, it is concluded that the WRF model performed with SAM is a good combination to simulate local wind speed and wind energy for local consumption.},

These modeling advances include accurate cost and power modeling, partial wake interaction, and the effects of varying atmospheric stability. To validate the use of this advanced modeling system, it is employed within an Extended Pattern Search (EPS)-Multi-Agent System (MAS) optimization approach for multiple wind scenarios. The wind farm layout optimization problem involves optimizing the position and size of wind turbines such that the aerodynamic effects of upstream turbines are reduced, which increases the effective wind speed and resultant power at each turbine. The EPS-MAS optimization algorithm employs a profit objective, and an overarching search determines individual turbine positions, with a concurrent EPS-MAS determining the optimal hub height and rotor diameter for each turbine. Two wind cases are considered: (1) constant, unidirectional wind, and (2) three discrete wind speeds and varying wind directions, each of which have a probability of occurrence. Results show the advantages of applying the series of advanced models compared to previous application of an EPS with less advanced models to wind farm layout optimization, and imply best practices for computational optimization of wind farms with improved accuracy.},

The model is based on the method of least squares (LES). By applying the proposed model on the sets of measured data taken at least at three measurement heights, one obtains a synthetic set of data at a desired height where the wind power potential is analyzed. The basic idea is that during the process of estimation of the wind power potential the measurement data are first extrapolated by the proposed method and then by using program WAsP the spatial extrapolation is carried out. The algorithm is tested by one year wind speed measurement data taken at three locations characterized by different topographies of the terrain and different climatic conditions. The performed analyses show that pre-processing of measurement data by the proposed method results in a better estimate of the wind power potential at a height which is greater than the measurement heights compared to that obtained by the standard application of WAsP program which makes use of measurement data taken at one measurement height.},

  abstract = {Three engineering wake models are compared with power production data from the Horns Rev and Lillgrund offshore wind farms. Single and multiple wake cases are investigated to verify the performance of the models in different conditions. The simulations reveal that the three wake models have similar behaviours for both wind farms although the turbine spacing and the turbulence intensity are different. The results prove the robustness of the models to provide accurate power predictions when the simulations are averaged over wind direction sectors of 30◦. However, all models significantly underpredict the power production of a single row of wind turbines using narrow sectors of 3◦ or 5◦. This discrepancy is discussed and justified by the wind direction uncertainty included in the datasets.},

  abstract = {An Evolutive Algorithm (EA) for wind farm optimal overall design is presented. The algorithm objective is to optimize the profits given an investment on a wind farm. Net Present Value (NPV) will be used as a figure of the revenue in the proposed method. To estimate the NPV is necessary to calculate the initial capital investment and net cash flow throughout the wind farm life cycle. The maximization of the NPV means the minimization of the investment and the maximization of the net cash flows (to maximise the generation of energy and minimise the power losses). Both terms depend mainly on the number and type of wind turbines, the tower height and geographical position, electrical layout, among others. Besides, other auxiliary costs must be to keep in mind to calculate the initial investment such as the cost of auxiliary roads or tower foundations. The difficulty of the problem is mainly due to the fact that there is neither analytic function to model the wind farm costs nor analytic function to model net generation. The complexity of this problem arises not only from a technical point of view, due to strong links between its variables, but also from a purely mathematical point of view. The problem consists of both discrete and continuous variables, being therefore an integer-mixed type problem. The problem exhibits manifold optimal solutions (convexity), some variables have a range of non allowed values (solutions space not simply connected) and others are integers. This fact makes the problem non-derivable, preventing the use of classical analytical optimization techniques.},

  abstract = {Turbulent wakes trailing utility-scale wind turbines reduce the power production and efficiency of downstream turbines. Thorough understanding and modeling of these wakes is required to optimally design wind farms as well as control and predict their power production. While low-order, physics-based wake models are useful for qualitative physical understanding, they generally are unable to accurately predict the power production of utility-scale wind farms due to a large number of simplifying assumptions and neglected physics. In this study, we propose a suite of physics-informed statistical models to accurately predict the power production of arbitrary wind farm layouts. These models are trained and tested using five years of historical one-minute averaged operational data from the Summerview wind farm in Alberta, Canada. The trained models reduce the prediction error compared both to a physics-based wake model and a standard two-layer neural network. The trained parameters of the statistical models are visualized and interpreted in the context of the flow physics of turbulent wind turbine wakes.},

  abstract = {Wind turbines installed in a wind farm can be affected by wake from neighboring wind turbines, which reduces power production and shortens turbine life due to mechanical fatigue. Therefore, careful consideration of the wake effects is necessary before establishing an optimum layout design for wind farms. Until now, various numerical models have been developed and applied to evaluate the wake effects, but comparison among (and verification of) the measurement results conducted at numerous wind farms have been few and insufficient. To verify the prediction accuracy of engineering wake models, namely, eddy viscosity, Larsen, Jensen, and Frandsen models, which are widely used in wind energy business, the current study presents the results of the comparative analysis of the values measured at a commercially operated onshore wind farm. The results demonstrate that the Jensen model is the best model in predicting the wake-centered velocity deficit under a specific wind-speed condition, and the eddy viscosity and Larsen models are relatively accurate in predicting the width of the wake and its profile. In conclusion, we need to carefully apply a model for wake-effect assessment based on the spacing between wind turbines because the prediction accuracy of the wake models varies with the downstream distance condition.},

The methodology in the IEC 61400-12-2 standard is solely based on the nacelle anemometry instead of the more traditional methods involving a met-mast, as per the IEC 61400-12-1 standard. In the IEC 61400-12-2 standard the wind speed, which is the key for all the power performance characteristics, will be measured using an anemometer mounted on or near the wind turbine’s nacelle. Thus the measured wind speed in this location will be strongly affected by the wind turbine’s rotor and the nacelle. Suitable correction against such flow distortion is applied through a nacelle transfer function (NTF). The -12-2 standard requires a self-consistency check performed on such established NTF using the nacelle power curve. Most of these selfconsistency checks have failed to meet the criteria listed in the standard. The root cause analysis against such failure showed that the methodology followed by the standard is less accurate in estimating the free stream wind speed. Suitable changes were made in the process of establishing the nacelle transfer function and the subsequent self-consistency checks were found to be clearing the criteria set by the standard.},

The unsteady simulations embed Coriolis forces and neutral stability conditions in the surface layer and stable conditions in the free stream. The BEM method is implemented in the CFD code through a pre-processing set of files that employs look-up tables. The control system for the wind turbines is considered through look-up tables that are constructed based on operational wind farm data. Simulations using the actuator disc and BEM methodologies have been performed using a number of different turbulence models in order to compare the wind turbine wake structure results. The use of URANS and LES numerical methods, coupled with the two different methodologies of representing the turbine, enables an assessment to be made of the details required for varying degrees of accuracy in computing the wake structures. The findings stress the importance of including the rotation of the wake and the non-uniform load on the rotor in LES simulations to account for more accurate turbulence intensity levels in the near wake.},

  abstract = {Dimensioning and assessment of a specific wind turbine imply iterative steps for design optimization, as well as load calculations and performance analyses of the system in various environmental conditions. However, due to the complexity of wind turbine systems, fully coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic codes are indispensable to represent and simulate the non-linear system behavior. To cope with the large number of simulations to be performed during the design process of a wind turbine system, automation of simulation executions and optimization procedures are required. In this paper, such a holistic simulation and optimization framework is presented, by which means iterative simulations within the wind turbine design assessment and development processes can be managed and executed in an automated and high-performance manner. The focus lies on the application to design load case simulations, as well as the realization of automated optimizations. The proper functioning and the high flexibility of the framework tool is shown based on three exemplary optimization tasks.},

Two different new wake models in off-shore wind farms have been studied comparatively. Their characteristics have been analyzed through mathematical modeling and derivation. Meanwhile, simulation experiments show that the proposed two new wake models have different properties. Furthermore, the distributions of wind speed and wind direction are modeled by the statistical methods and Extreme Learning Machine through the off-shore wind farms of Yangshan Deepwater Harbor in the Port of Shanghai, China. In addition, the data of wind energy are provided to verify and test the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed two models. Wind power has been demonstrated by wind rose and wind resources with real-time data. These techniques contribute to enhance planning, utilization and exploitation for wind power of off-shore wind farms.},

However, minimization of the distance between single wind turbines within a wind farm causes an increase of the so called wake effect, which is introduced by the shadowing of some wind turbines by the other units within the farm and as a consequence causes a turbulent flow. This leads to the reduction of energy yield in the shadowed units. For the offshore wind farms which consist of 100 and more wind turbines is this effect especially significant.},

  abstract = {Abstract             We present two new models for wind turbine interaction effects and a recipe for combining them. The first model is an extension of the Park model, which explicitly incorporates turbulence, both the ambient atmospheric turbulence and the turbulence generated in the wake itself. This Turbulence Optimized Park model is better equipped to describe wake recovery over long distances such as between wind farms, where the wake expansion slows down as the turbine-generated turbulence decays. The second model is a first version of a full engineering wind farm blockage model. In the same vein as the wake model it adds blockage contributions from the individual wind turbines to form an aggregated wind farm scale blockage effect that can be incorporated directly into the park power curve and annual energy calculations. The wake model and the blockage model describe downstream and upstream turbine interaction effects, respectively. They are coupled as the outputs of one model are the inputs to the other model and vice versa. We describe how this coupling is achieved through an iterative process. We give early stage examples of the validation of the two models and discuss how they might be further validated and improved in the future.},

We analyse a case with steady wind direction approximately aligned with the turbine rows. The radar measurements allow us to track the evolution of the wakes through the wind farm and further downstream. In the case studied here the wake region extends at least 17 km downstream of the wind farm. Both models are in good agreement with observations provided a coastal gradient is accounted for. The generality of this conclusion is tested by comparing modelled wind speeds with observations aggregated over multiple cases with a similar inflow wind direction.},

The evaluation is performed on data classified in four different atmospheric stability conditions, for a narrow wind speed range, and a wide range of westerly wind directions observed at the wind farm. Simulations (post-processed to partly account for the wind direction uncertainty) and observations show good agreement for all stability classes, being the simulations using a stability-dependent wake decay coefficient closer to the data for the last turbines on the row and those using the WAsP recommended value closer to the data for the first turbines. It is generally seen that under stable and unstable atmospheric conditions the power deficits are the highest and lowest, respectively, but the wind conditions under both stability regimes are different. The ensemble average of the simulations does not approach the limits of the infinite wind farm under any stability condition as such averages account for directions misaligned with the row.},

  abstract = {This paper presents some technical details, operational experiences, and lessons learnt by the Colombian public utility – Empresas Pu´ blicas de Medellı´n – with a recently installed 19.5 MW wind park in the northern region of Colombia – province of La Guajira. This is the first ever wind park feeding to the electricity network in Colombia. The Jepirachi Wind Park was commissioned in April 2004 and it has to date accumulated nearly 180,000 h of operation. During that time 15 NORDEX N60/1.3 MW turbines have fed electricity to the Colombian main electricity grid. This work describes the park layout, including meteorological stations installed in the surroundings and the wind regime prevailing in the zone. Details are also given about remote monitoring of the Wind Park and individual turbines, through the Supervisory, Control and Data Acquisition system (SCADA Nordex Control 2). Since July 2004, Empresas Pu´ blicas de Medellı´n (EEPPM) and Universidad de Los Andes-Bogota´ , Colombia have been working together in a wind park performance monitoring programme. This has permitted both institutions to learn more rapidly matters relating to evaluation, planning and operation of wind parks exposed to extreme climatic conditions like those present in the semi-desert region of the Guajira. This work describes the wind park operation, where individual wind turbines have yielded monthly production capacity factors as high as 65–75\%; values which are high when compared to similar turbines installed elsewhere. Accordingly, levels of electrical energy production of up to 1750 kWh/m2-year per turbine have been measured, exceeding typical values reported in the wind energy literature. A series of operational and technical troubles have become evident, which are related to some of the particular features of the climate and the wind regime at the site of the Jepirachi Wind Park. Because of these local features it is suggested that a greater level of uncertainty (limiting the validity of methods and hypotheses) may exist in the study and planning of future wind parks in regions such as La Guajira.},

Currently, several floating turbine concepts are being designed and tested in small scale projects; in particular, one concept allows the turbine to move after installation. This article presents a novel layout optimization framework for wind farms composed of moveable floating turbines. The proposed framework uses an evolutionary optimization strategy in a nested configuration which simultaneously optimizes the anchoring locations and the wind turbine position within the mooring lines for each individual wind direction. The results show that maximum energy production is obtained when moveable wind turbines are deployed in an optimized layout. In conclusion, the framework represents a new design optimization tool for future offshore wind farms composed of moveable floating turbines.},

The comparison of different far wake models shows that the Jensen's far wake model is a good choice to solve the wind farm layout problem due to its simplicity and relatively high degree of accuracy. This research also focuses on the studies carried out on wind farm layout optimization problem and the current state of the art of fitness functions used for the optimization of wind farms using Jensen's wake model. It is found that there is a need of more optimization techniques to be applied to solve the layout problem.

  abstract = {A new method of evaluating the degradation of wind turbine power performance was investigated on Jeju Island, South Korea in compliance with IEC international standards. Evaluating wind turbine degradation fairly within a year is difficult because wind speed varies annually. Thus, three wind turbines on the Hankyeong wind farm were tested to obtain the Nacelle power curves (NPCs) for a period of six years (from 2008 to 2013). The terrain of the wind farm was assessed; furthermore, an 80-m met mast was analyzed along with the nacelle wind speed within the measurement sector to determine the Nacelle transfer function (NTF). Six years of NPCs were determined with the NTFs. On the basis of these curves, each Capacity factor (CF) of the turbines was calculated by applying wind and electric power data derived from the SCADA system. These calculations were compared with the conventional normalized CF. The degradation of the normalized CF was approximately 0.26\% per year on average based on the NPCs for the three wind turbines; this degradation was roughly 1.1\% when the conventional approach was used.},

  abstract = {To examine the applicability of the nacelle transfer function (NTF) derived from nacelle light detection and ranging (LIDAR) measurements to wind turbine power performance testing without a met mast, wind turbine power performance measurement was carried out at the Dongbok wind farm on Jeju Island, South Korea. A nacelle LIDAR was mounted on the nacelle of a 2-MW wind turbine to measure wind conditions in front of the turbine rotor, and an 80-m-high met mast was installed near another wind turbine to measure the free-stream wind speed. The power measurement instruments were installed in the turbine tower base, and wind speeds measured by the nacelle anemometer of the turbine were collected by the SCADA (Supervisory control and data acquisition) system. The NTF was determined by the table method, and then the power curve drawn using the NTF by the nacelle LIDAR (PCNTF, NL) was compared with the power curves drawn in compliance with International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards, 61400-12-1 and 61400-12-2. Next, the combined standard uncertainties of the power curves were calculated to clarify the magnitude of the components of the uncertainties. The uncertainties of annual energy production (AEP) were also estimated by assuming that wind speed is a Rayleigh cumulative distribution. As a result, the PCNTF, NL was in good agreement with the power curves drawn in accordance with the IEC standards. The combined standard uncertainty of PCNTF, NL was almost the same as that of the power curve based on IEC 61400-12-2.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Despite their potential as a valuable source of individual turbine power performance and turbine array energy production optimization information, nacelle-mounted anemometers have often been neglected because complex flows around the blades and nacelle interfere with their measurements. This work quantitatively explores the accuracy of and potential corrections to nacelle anemometer measurements to determine the degree to which they may be useful when corrected for these complex flows, particularly for calculating annual energy production (AEP) in the absence of other meteorological data. Using upwind meteorological tower measurements along with nacelle-based measurements from a General Electric (GE) 1.5sle model, we calculate empirical nacelle transfer functions (NTFs) and explore how they are impacted by different atmospheric and turbulence parameters. This work provides guidelines for the use of NTFs for deriving useful wind measurements from nacelle-mounted anemometers. Corrections to the nacelle anemometer wind speed measurements can be made with NTFs and used to calculate an AEP that comes within 1 \% of an AEP calculated with upwind measurements. We also calculate unique NTFs for different atmospheric conditions defined by temperature stratification as well as turbulence intensity, turbulence kinetic energy, and wind shear. During periods of low stability as defined by the Bulk Richardson number (\emph{R}\textsubscript{B}), the nacelle-mounted anemometer underestimates the upwind wind speed more than during periods of high stability at some wind speed bins below rated speed, leading to a steeper NTF during periods of low stability. Similarly, during periods of high turbulence, the nacelle-mounted anemometer underestimates the upwind wind speed more than during periods of low turbulence at most wind bins between cut-in and rated wind speed. Based on these results, we suggest different NTFs be calculated for different regimes of atmospheric stability and turbulence for power performance validation purposes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {A new two-dimensional (2D) wake model is developed and validated in this article to predict the velocity and turbulence distribution in the wake of a wind turbine. Based on the classical Jensen wake model, this model is further employing a cosine shape function to redistribute the spread of the wake deficit in the crosswind direction. Moreover, a variable wake decay rate is proposed to take into account both the ambient turbulence and the rotor generated turbulence, different from a constant wake decay rate used in the Jensen model. The obtained results are compared to field measurements, wind tunnel experiments, and results of an advanced k À ω turbulence model as well as large eddy simulations. From the comparisons, it is found that the proposed new wake model gives a good prediction in terms of both shape and velocity amplitude of the wake deficit, especially in the far wake which is the region of interest for wind farm development projects.},

  abstract = {A modeling framework is proposed and validated to simulate turbine wakes and associated power losses in wind farms. It combines the large-eddy simulation (LES) technique with blade element theory and a turbine-model-specific relationship between shaft torque and rotational speed. In the LES, the turbulent subgrid-scale stresses are parameterized with a tuning-free Lagrangian scale-dependent dynamic model. The turbine-induced forces and turbine-generated power are modeled using a recently developed actuator-disk model with rotation (ADM-R), which adopts blade element theory to calculate the lift and drag forces (that produce thrust, rotor shaft torque and power) based on the local simulated flow and the blade characteristics. In order to predict simultaneously the turbine angular velocity and the turbineinduced forces (and thus the power output), a new iterative dynamic procedure is developed to couple the ADM-R turbine model with a relationship between shaft torque and rotational speed. This relationship, which is unique for a given turbine model and independent of the inflow condition, is derived from simulations of a stand-alone wind turbine in conditions for which the thrust coefficient can be validated. Comparison with observed power data from the Horns Rev wind farm shows that better power predictions are obtained with the dynamic ADM-R than with the standard ADM, which assumes a uniform thrust distribution and ignores the torque effect on the turbine wakes and rotor power. The results are also compared with the power predictions obtained using two commercial wind-farm design tools (WindSim and WAsP). These models are found to underestimate the power output compared with the results from the proposed LES framework.},

  abstract = {With the growing number of wind farms over the last decades and the availability of large datasets, research in wind-farm flow modeling - one of the key components in optimizing the design and operation of wind farms - is shifting towards data-driven techniques. However, given that most current data-driven algorithms have been developed for canonical problems, the enormous complexity of fluid flows in real wind farms poses unique challenges for data-driven flow modeling. These include the high-dimensional multiscale nature of turbulence at high Reynolds numbers, geophysical and atmospheric effects, wake-flow development, and incorporating wind-turbine characteristics and wind-farm layouts, among others. In addition, data-driven wind-farm flow models should ideally be interpretable and have some degree of generalizability. The former is important to avoid a lack of trust in the models with end-users, while the most popular strategy for the latter is to incorporate known physics into the models. This article reviews a collection of recent studies on wind-farm flow modeling covering both purely data-driven and physics-guided approaches. We provide a thorough analysis of their modeling approach, objective, and methodology, and specifically focus on the data utilized in the reviewed works.},

However, none of the existing wake superposition methods conserve the streamwise momentum. In this study, a novel wake superposition method capable of conserving the total momentum deficit in the streamwise direction is derived theoretically, and its performance is validated with both particle imaging velocimetry measurements and large-eddy simulation results. Detailed inter-method comparisons show that the novel wake superposition method outperforms all the existing methods by delivering an accurate prediction of the power production and the centreline wake velocity deficit, with a typical error of less than 5~\% (excluding the near-wake region). Additionally, the momentum-conserving wake superposition method is extended to combine the transverse velocities induced by yawed wind turbines, and the secondary wake steering effect crucial to the power optimization in active wake control is well reproduced.},
